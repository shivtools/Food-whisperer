# ScrapeYourLunch
A tiny web scraper to fetch lunch and dinner menus from dhall.

Anyone who knows me knows that I am always hungry. I made a tiny web scraper to get dhall's lunch and dinner menu's from the university's website. 

Run it by navigating to the proper directory and typing:

```
python scraper.py
```

Please note that this project wasn't created with the intention to infringe upon any data privacy laws. It was only made to satiate my incurable and everlasting hunger.
